# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Gene-Expression-Characterization
Intro to Genomic Information for Science &amp; Technology group project by Peter Tzelios, Lixia Chen Wu,and Valentina Bos. Explored biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease using scRNA-seq data and neural networks.


Files Overview:
EDA.ipynb

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the full scRNA-seq dataset.
Includes quality control, visualization, and global structure analysis such as:

UMAP embeddings

Cell-type distributions

Basic expression summaries

This notebook provides an overall understanding of the dataset before modeling.
